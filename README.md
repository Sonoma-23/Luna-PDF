# Luna PDF

Luna PDF is a simple, PDF viewer built with Python and Tkinter.

Also I haven't tested this on Windows, but it should work.

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.10+.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow PyMuPDF
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   luna-pdf.py
   ```

## Controls
- **Open**: `File -> Open` 
- **Zoom In/Out**: `i` / `o`
- **Next/Previous Page**: `scroll wheel`
- **Center**: `c`
- **Quit**: `File -> Quit`
